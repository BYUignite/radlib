## C++ examples 
* These examples correspond to the python examples, but are only setup for the RCSLW case.
* There is a simple_interface.cc file that demonstrates the use of the library.
* Examples are Example ex_S1.cc through ex_S5.cc, ex_B3.cc, and ex_Sb1.cc.
* The solver here is parallel_planes.cc
* The examples are built by the cmake system, but there is a simple build script ```build_examples.sh``` provided for illustration.
    * **Be sure to set the location of the include and lib directories for the installed code.**
* There is also a script to execute the examples: ```run_examples.sh```.
